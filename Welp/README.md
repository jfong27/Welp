#  Welp

## Device 
I used the iPhone X simulator to test Welp. For some reason, I got some bugs with the map and profile when using my iPad. I don't know if it's because it's a physical device or because it's an iPad.  

## Test Account

## Other
You can add a profile picture, but I haven't implemented adding photos to reviews yet. 
Search is not implemented yet. 
There is a bug when adding a new review from the search tab. Duplicate reviews appear.
